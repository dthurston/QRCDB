1. First, I'm not a programmer.  What I've done is incorporataed some software and make a nice QR Code database
for tracking your things.

You'll more than likely see some issues with my SQL statements and useage of PHP code.  My goal is to first
opensource what I have, then make it even better.

Thanks goes out to Dominik Dzienia for his PHP QR Code generator (http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/) and Larry Ulman 
(http://www.larryullman.com/) for his PHP & MySQL books.

2.  Some of the files that you might be interested in
